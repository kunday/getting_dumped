GettingDumped is an rspec formatter that collects metrics information on tests across multiple runs.

Get dumped, this time for a good reason!

This project is still under active development.

h2. Installation

Installing GettingDumped is easy. 
You can add the GettingDumped gem by adding it to Gemfile as follows:

bc. gem "getting_dumped"

or if you don't use bundler for package management, you can install it using

bc. gem install getting_dumped

from the command line.
Just put it in your @Gemfile@ and run your specs like this from now on:

bc. $ rspec --format GettingDumped --color spec

If you want to use GettingDumped as your default formatter, simply put the options in your @.rspec@ file:

bc. --format GettingDumped
--color

Once you start running tests, it will collect the test run times and dump it to the local sqlite database.

You can view the output by typing in:

bc. bundle exec getting_dumped_server

You can then browse the run information at

bc. http://localhost:4567/runs
